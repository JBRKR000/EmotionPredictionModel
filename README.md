# Emotions Prediction Model

This project is a university assignment aimed at predicting emotions from text data using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/emotions). It contains a collection of English text samples labeled with different emotions.

### Emotion Labels
Each entry in this dataset consists of a text segment representing a Twitter message and a corresponding label indicating the predominant emotion conveyed. The emotions are classified into six categories:
- Sadness (0) ‚òπÔ∏è
- Joy (1) üòÑ
- Love (2) ü•∞
- Anger (3) üò†
- Fear (4) üò®
- Surprise (5) üò≤

## Description
The Emotions Prediction Model project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify emotions expressed in text data. The model is trained on the provided dataset and then used to predict the emotions associated with new text inputs.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)
- Natural Language Processing (NLTK)
- PyQt5 (for the GUI)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Download and insert to your main program folder `emotions-dataset.csv` file.
4. Run the `main.py` file to launch the GUI application.
5. Enter the text input in the provided text field.
6. Click on the "Predict" button to see the predicted emotion.
